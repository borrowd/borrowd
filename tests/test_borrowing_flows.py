# Use SimpleTestCase to prevent database cleanup between tests.
class RejectedFlowTest(SimpleTestCase):
    """
    This sequential set of tests is designed to test each step along
    the a borrowing flow which ultimately ends up Rejected.

    Note there does not seem to be a more formal way to specify the
    order in which tests should be run, other than to wrangle their
    alphabetical order as done below. This is probably because
    logical dependencies between tests is normally seen as a big red
    flag.

    However, there are exceptions to every rule, and in this
    scenario, where the objective is to test a workflow with multiple
    sequential steps, I feel it makes much more sense to test each
    step of a workflow as a separate test, each building on the
    previous. We still have encapsulation from the rest of the test
    suite by virtue keeping all relevant tests within this test class.

    The alternative would be to either A) have a single test with
    lots and lots of assertions crammed in, or B) have multiple tests
    with each having to rebuild the entire context each time, and
    only formally testing the "new" step added in each. IMO, flexing
    the rule of "no dependencies between tests" is preferable in this
    situation.
